### üìà Featured Projects

1. **FinRAG**
   - Tech Stack: Python, NLP, LLM, RAG
   - Developed an advanced RAG-based intelligent assistant for financial reports, such as 10-K filings, enabling
   efficient context-aware responses to user queries.
   - Implemented robust document processing by parsing and embedding chunked data with chunk IDs and
   populating a Chroma vector database using a financial embedding model.
   - Integrated advanced retrieval techniques, including re-ranking, hybrid search, query expansion, and
   multi-query retrieval, to provide precise answers, enhancing performance and saving time.
   - Used fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2 and Mistral models, served locally on Ollama, for generating accurate responses.
   - Built an interactive Streamlit-based interface that supports querying stored reports or uploading new
   documents
   - Achieved 85% accuracy in query-response evaluations and improved retrieval efficiency by 30%, reducing
   query processing time by leveraging optimized embeddings and retrieval pipelines
   - Enabled the system to handle up to multiple document formats with a retrieval latency of less than 10
   seconds for most queries

3. **World-Econ-Growth-Forecast**
   - Tech Stack: Python, Machine Learning, MLOps, GCP
   - Developed a scalable LSTM model on GCP for GDP growth forecasting in IMF countries.
   - Built automated data pipelines using Cloud Composer (Airflow) and implemented MLOps with drift detection and data validation via Pydantic.
   - Enhanced monitoring with logging systems and email alerts for robust model performance.
   - **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gosainisharg/World-Econ-Growth-Forecast)**

4. **Queryfi**
   - Tech Stack: Python, NLP, Transfer Learning
   - Built a text-to-SQL tool using BART and T5, improving semantic parsing.
   - Fine-tuned neural translation models and optimized them on the WikiSQL benchmark.
   - Proposed a novel approach, advancing text-to-SQL conversion techniques.
